# birthday_wish_on_fb
I have implemented a simple script of how to wish everyone on birthdays so that no one misses it. 
You can setup this in cron and run daily. So that we don't miss to wish.

I have used https://github.com/dhruvramani/Terminal-on-FB-Messenger to get the base how to go through.

It is easy and well written script.
